# Wait, maybe user wants to commit workflows? 
# The user said "save the work till now". 
# Usually user data isn't committed, but initial demo workflows might be useful.
# I'll keep workflows in for now, or maybe ignore them? 
# Let's ignore generated user data but maybe keep example ones if they exist. 
# For now, I will NOT ignore backend/workflows, assuming they are part of the 'work'.
# But typically db/storage is ignored.
# I'll stick to standard ignores.
